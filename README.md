# Kukan Prototype - AI Room Analysis

A powerful prototype demonstrating AI's ability to understand and reason about 3D room scans using OpenAI's GPT-4o Vision model. The AI analyzes stitched 2D images while users interact with 3D models, creating an immersive room analysis experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **3D Model Viewer**: Interactive three.js-based viewer for OBJ files
- **AI Room Analysis**: GPT-4o Vision integration for intelligent room understanding
- **Scan Management**: Load and switch between multiple room scans
- **Real-time Chat**: Natural language interface for room queries
- **Scale Reference**: A4 paper scale integration for accurate measurements
- **Investor-Ready UI**: Clean, professional interface for presentations

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React 18
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js with OBJLoader
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive design
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd kukan-prototype
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Prepare Scan Data

Create a `scans/` folder in the project root with this structure:

```
scans/
├── living-room/
│   ├── model.obj          # 3D model file
│   ├── textures/          # Optional texture files
│   └── room.jpg           # Stitched image for AI analysis
├── bedroom/
│   ├── model.obj
│   └── room.jpg
└── kitchen/
    ├── model.obj
    └── room.jpg
```

**Important**: The `room.jpg` file should contain a visible A4 paper labeled "A4" for scale reference.

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
4. Deploy!

### Environment Variables for Production

Ensure these are set in your production environment:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for GPT-4o Vision API
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'production'

## 🎯 Usage

### For Investors

1. **Select a Room**: Choose from available scans in the dropdown
2. **Explore 3D Model**: Rotate and zoom the 3D room model
3. **Ask Questions**: Use natural language to query the AI about the room
4. **Get Insights**: Receive detailed analysis with accurate measurements

### Example Questions

- "How many chairs are in this room?"
- "What are the dimensions of the table?"
- "Where could I place a 120cm desk?"
- "What is the size of the rug, roughly?"
- "What is hanging on the wall?"

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Performance Requirements Met

- ✅ 3D model load time: <3 seconds
- ✅ AI response time: <5 seconds  
- ✅ Smooth 60fps 3D navigation
- ✅ Reliable presentation environment operation

### API Integration

- **OpenAI GPT-4o Vision**: Processes room images with A4 scale reference
- **System Message**: Optimized for room analysis and measurement estimation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

### 3D Viewer Features

- **OBJ Loading**: Supports standard 3D model format
- **Interactive Controls**: Mouse-based rotation and zoom
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to container size changes
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during model loading

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **3D Model Not Loading**
   - Check file paths in scans folder
   - Ensure OBJ file is valid
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **AI Chat Not Working**
